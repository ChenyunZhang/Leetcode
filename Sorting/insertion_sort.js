// insertion sort builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger left half which is always sorted
// start by picking the second element in the array
// compare the second element with the one before it and swap if nexessary
// continue to the next Element,emt and if it is the incorrect order
// iterate throught the sorrted portion to the place the element in the correct place
// repeat until the array is sorted
